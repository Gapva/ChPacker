# Resources
If you are using this tool to convert outdated/old CTGP-7 character mods
*or* if you want to convert a non-CTGP-7 character to CTGP-7,
the file structure for the character must follow [this formatting guide](https://mk3ds.com/index.php?title=Character_Pack).
Keep in mind that `.chpack`s *cannot* and *should not* contain subfolders,
so all of your files should be directly in the root of the file structure.

# Installation
Read all the above? You can install ChPacker by heading over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Gapva/ChPacker/releases/latest) tab
and downloading the file for your operating system (currently, only Windows is supported)
